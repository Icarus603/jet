# Jet v1.0.0 Release Tracking

Use this document as the canonical milestone checklist for 1.0 delivery.

## Gates

- [x] Security baseline gates complete (`docs/security-model.md`)
- [ ] CI strictness gates complete
- [ ] Release artifact gates complete
- [ ] Docs + operations gates complete

## Phase Checklist

- [x] Phase 0: Baseline freeze and tracking
- [ ] Phase 1: Hard blocker fixes
- [ ] Phase 2: Linker/runtime hardening
- [ ] Phase 3: Security baseline closure
- [ ] Phase 4: CLI behavior completion
- [ ] Phase 5: CI gate hardening
- [ ] Phase 6: Release artifacts and packaging
- [ ] Phase 7: Documentation and operational readiness
- [ ] Phase 8: RC and GA rollout

## Current Status (2026-02-15)

- Local quality gates are green on macOS:
  - `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
  - `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  - `bash scripts/check_safety_docs.sh`
  - `cargo test --workspace`
  - `cargo test -p jet-integration-tests --test test_compiler_pipeline`
- CI/release hardening updates completed in repository:
  - Windows workflows removed (Jet 1.0 supports macOS/Linux only).
  - CI adds required release file gate (`scripts/check_release_files.sh`).
  - Permissive `|| true` paths removed from docs/release scripts.
  - Release workflow now validates required release files before build jobs.
- Remaining blockers to call Jet fully production-ready are:
  - green CI evidence on Linux/macOS after these changes,
  - branch protection required-check configuration in GitHub settings,
  - release dry-run artifact install smoke tests and RC/GA execution.
