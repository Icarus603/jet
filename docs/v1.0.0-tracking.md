## Current Status (2026-02-19)

### Local Gate Status: GREEN

Verified on macOS with:
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- `cargo test --workspace`
- `bash scripts/check_safety_docs.sh`

All commands completed successfully.

### CI/CD and Release Pipeline Status

- CI workflow includes required quality gates (`fmt`, `clippy`, `test-linux`, `test-macos`, safety docs, release-files).
- Release workflow includes Linux/macOS artifacts, SBOM generation, and Sigstore signing.
- Required release metadata is enforced by `scripts/check_release_files.sh`.

### Scope-Limited Areas Tracked for Post-1.0

These remain intentionally outside strict 1.0 guarantees:
- Features explicitly marked as future-reserved in the language spec appendix.
